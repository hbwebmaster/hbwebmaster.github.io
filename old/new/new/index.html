                <h7>Honor System?</h7>
                <p>Formed in 1908, the Stevens Honor System and the Honor Board that governs it were developed to fulfill two main objectives: to ensure that submitted work can be trusted as a student’s own and to promote a sense of honor and integrity in preparation for the professional world.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>The Honor System is only effective with the continued support of the students, faculty, and administration at Stevens. The Honor Board, the governing body of the Honor System, serves to ensure that academic integrity is upheld around campus.</p>
