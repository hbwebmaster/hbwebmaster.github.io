"Throughout my educational career and my personal life, I have adhered to a set of core moral standards. Among the most important of my values are respect for others, honesty towards myself and those around me, and above all, doing everything in a fair manner. I am running for Honor Board because I am fiercely proud that I have gotten to where I stand now by sticking to these guiding principles. Not only do I hold the Stevens Core Values-honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility-to heart, but I am also a confident speaker who can help others understand how the Honor System protects these key tenets. Moreover, I am good at listening actively to people both individually and during a proceeding. Finally, with respect to investigations, I have the ability to isolate the facts of a case and render an objective judgment. Going forward, I want to set a conspicuous example of academic integrity and personal character by serving on the Honor Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"I would like to be a part of the Honor Board because I feel that Stevens' honor and integrity is something that makes this school special and a great place to be a part of.  I also feel that it's important that everyone gets a fair trial and isn't wrongly persecuted for something they are being accused of.  I can contribute a fresh, fair, and understanding voice to the Board.  I believe in keeping everything fair and hearing all sides of a situation and making sure the appropriate decision and actions are made."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
