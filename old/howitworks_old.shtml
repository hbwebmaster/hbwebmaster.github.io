    <h1 class="style5">How <strong>it Works</strong></h1>
    <h2 class="style3">Student Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Enrollment into the undergraduate class of Stevens Institute of Technology signifies a student's commitment to the Honor System. It is the responsibility of each student to become acquainted with and to uphold the ideals set forth in the Honor System Constitution. Specific student responsibilities include:</p>
<p class="style12">Maintaining honesty and fair play in all aspects of academic life at Stevens.</p>
<p class="style12">Writing and signing the pledge, in full, on all submitted academic work.</p>
<p class="style12">'Reporting any suspected violations to an the Honor Board via the <a href="violationreport.shtml">online submission form</a>.</p>
<p class="style12">Cooperating with the Honor Board during investigations and hearings.</p>
    <h2 class="style3">Pledge of the Honor System</h2>
    <p>The pledge signifies that the work submitted by a student is indeed his/her own. There is one designated pledge to be used for tests, homework assignments, lab reports, and computer projects. The pledge shall be written in full and signed by the student on all submitted academic work. Any references used (including texts, tutors, classmates, etc.) should be listed below the written pledge.</p>
<p class="style7"><strong>"I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System."</strong></p>
    <h2 class="style3">Faculty Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>As a member of the Stevens community, it is the responsibility of each faculty member to understand and abide by the Honor System. It is not the role of the faculty member to resolve suspected violations, but to report these alleged infractions to an Honor Board member or to the Dean of Student Development.
      A paramount responsibility of the faculty is to insure that the pledge is fully written and signed on all collected academic work.</p>
<span class="style10">
<p>Additional faculty responsibilities include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Appearing before investigating committees and hearings, as well as
        participating in other functions, when requested to do so by the
        Honor Board.</li>
		<li>Educating new faculty and teaching assistants regarding the
        principles and operations of the Honor System.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="style3">Violations</h2>
    <p>A violation is any action that does not conform to the spirit of the Stevens Honor System. Any situation in which a student has an unfair advantage over a classmate(s) constitutes a violation.
      Failure in clearly citing all the references, if any, used in an assignment infringes upon the rights of others, and constitutes a violation. In instances where external sources are utilized, they must be identified and due credit given using an appropriate bibliography format.
      Tolerance is a violation of the Honor System; a student who is aware that the academic integrity of the Institute is being compromised and neglects to report this is guilty of an Honor System infraction.</p>
    <h2 class="style3">Honor Board Investigating Committees</h2>
    <p>Upon written notification of an alleged infraction, the chairman of the Honor Board will appoint an Investigating Committee (IC) consisting of two or more members of the Board. It is the role of the IC to conduct a thorough investigation into the violation by interviewing all persons connected with the case and reviewing any physical evidence.
      Information obtained during the investigation will be kept confidential and discreet by those parties involved with the case and by the Honor Board.
      The student accused of the violation will be notified of the pending investigation by the IC and be given the opportunity to present his/her explanation of what transpired to the committee. The accused may choose to sign a written confession at this time. If there is no confession, the accused party will be notified the result of the investigation. If there is insufficient evidence to support a violation, the case will be dropped. However, if there is sufficient evidence to question the academic integrity of the individual accused, then a Hearing date is scheduled.</p>
    <h2 class="style3">Hearings</h2>
    <p>Hearings may be open or closed depending on the
	wishes of the accused. An open hearing is restricted to members of the
	Stevens Community. The hearing begins with a statement of charge by the
	Honor Board and a response to this charge by the accused. The Honor Board
	introduces the case and proceeds by presenting evidence and calling
	witnesses. After the Honor Board presents the results of its investigation,
	the accused will have the chance to present any relevant evidence and call
	witnesses on his/her behalf. Both the Honor Board and the accused party will
	have the opportunity to question all witnesses.</p>
<p>During a hearing, the Chairman of the Honor Board will mediate the proceedings and deem what evidence and questioning is pertinent to the case. After carefully reviewing both sides of the case, a six member jury, comprised of the student's peers, will reach a unanimous decision of guilty or not guilty. If the outcome is "not guilty," then all charges are dropped. However, if the jury renders a "guilty" verdict, then the Honor Board prescribes a penalty that must be approved by the Dean of Student Development.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>

Penalty Matrix</a></strong></p>
    <h2 class="style3">Appeals</h2>
    <p>Submit a letter to Dean Rosemary Dice in the Office of Undergraduate Academics with the reasons for the appeal within fourteen (14) days from today. The Dean of Undergraduate Academics will review the appeal and based on the appeal criteria, decide if an appeal is granted.  If granted the Dean will give the appeal to the Academic Appeals committee.</p>
    <h2 class="style3">Responsibilities of the Honor Board</h2>
    <p>The Honor Board is responsible for presenting the philosophy and functions of the Honor System to the student body and faculty in a language that is readable and understandable. It is the duty of the Honor Board to interpret the constitution of the Honor System and to define violations of the Honor System.
      All investigations and hearings of the board must be executed in a quick and fair fashion. When a breach of the system has been committed, the Board recommends a penalty that may range from zero credit to be given on the questioned work to a maximum penalty of expulsion from the Institute.
      Honor Board members are eligible to vote on all decisions of the Board. It is the role of these members to serve on Investigating
	Committees when appointed by the chairman. The officers include the chairman, vice chairman, corresponding secretary, and recording secretary.</p>
    <h2 class="style3">Additional Notes</h2>
    <p class="style10">The Stevens Honor System is a dynamic one that facilitates the changing needs of both students and faculty. Its success is dependent upon the support of the entire Stevens community.
      The Honor System is a privilege of the students during their undergraduate years at Stevens. Students are encouraged to address any questions regarding the workings of the Honor System to an Honor Board member. The Honor System has been designed to protect
	<strong>you</strong>, the student. Preserving its strength and integrity is
	<strong>your</strong> responsibility.</p>
